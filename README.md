# m3g11-jsforms

I created this project by following along this tutorial:
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-javascript-form-validation-by-making-a-form/

The project should fulfill all the requirements in the theme idea of the guide, except that the form only has 3 types of data instead of 4.

I've tried explaining to my best ability what's happening in the Javascript code. Hopefully it makes sense :D
